# Nherformer (NH from my name, and it's a transformer, duh)
A transformer model inspired by the GPT approach and the "Attention is all you need" paper on transformers. This model is exclusively trained on Shakespeare's works for research and learning purposes.

## Attention Head Implementation
The Attention Head is implemented as a separate class for better code clarity, though this is not typically considered best practice.
